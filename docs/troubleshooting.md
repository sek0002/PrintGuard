## Starting up

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `bind: address already in use` for `8000` or `8554` | Another PrintGuard already holds the port, often a desktop app or a container you forgot | Find the holder with `lsof -nP -iTCP:8554 -sTCP:LISTEN` on macOS or Linux, or `netstat -ano \| findstr 8554` on Windows, then stop it. Versions before 2.3.8 could leave the streaming server behind after a crash |
| Dashboard loads but the header shows "Reconnecting" | The engine WebSocket cannot connect, usually a proxy that does not forward WebSockets, or a rewritten `Origin` | Check the proxy forwards upgrade headers, then see [origin checking](deployment.md#origin-checking) |
| First launch of the desktop app is blocked | The builds are unsigned | On macOS, open Privacy & Security in System Settings and click **Open Anyway**. On Windows, choose **More info** and then **Run anyway** |
| The desktop app opens an empty white window | Its server did not start. 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 on macOS always hit this, because Core ML could not load the model from a data directory whose path contains a space | Update to 2.3.9 or later, where the window reports what failed and shows the end of the log ([logs](#getting-logs-and-diagnostics)) |
| Container restarts repeatedly | Usually an unwritable `/data` volume | Check the volume mount and its permissions, then read `docker logs printguard` |

## Custom models

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Model missing from the selector | Bundle is outside the library, has an invalid directory name, or was added after startup | Use `/data/models/<lowercase-id>/model.json` and click Settings → Models → Refresh list |
| Switch reports model unavailable | Profile or file is missing or invalid | Correct the bundle and refresh; the previous active model remains selected |
| Hub reports missing `metadata.json` or `prototypes.json` | `MODEL_DIR` has no `model.json`, so the bundled encoder contract is selected | Put the custom profile in that directory, named exactly `model.json` |
| Custom ONNX model requires Automatic or ONNX Runtime | LiteRT was pinned before changing the model | Choose a supported runtime in Advanced; changing the selected model automatically selects Automatic |
| Input shape, class count or probability validation fails | The export does not match the profile | Check dimensions, layout, ordered class labels, output index and whether a classifier emits logits. Raw YOLO heads and exports with built-in NMS are not supported |
| Scores change substantially after switching models | Models have different confidence distributions | Recalibrate sensitivity and threshold against representative successful and failed prints before enabling automatic printer actions |

See [custom models](hardware.md#custom-models) for profiles and exact output contracts.

## Cameras and video

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Tile reads **no signal** | The source is unreachable from the hub, or it stopped producing frames | Open the stream URL from the machine running the hub, not from your laptop. In Docker, remember `localhost` means the container, so see [networking caveats](printers.md#networking-caveats) |
| Camera is **offline** in the registry but the feed works elsewhere | Wrong scheme or path, or a source that needs credentials in the URL | Re-test the URL. RTSP sources are pulled by MediaMTX, so it must reach them too |
| **This browser** camera will not start | Browsers only allow camera access on secure pages | Serve the hub over HTTPS or open it on `localhost`. [Deployment](deployment.md) covers both |
| A USB camera plugged into the host never appears | The container was not given it, or it was plugged in after the container started | Add a `devices:` entry for it and `docker compose up -d`. [Cameras plugged into the hub](printers.md#cameras-plugged-into-the-hub) |
| Several USB cameras on one machine drop out or crawl | They share the bus, and an uncompressed feed can take most of it on its own | Prefer cameras that offer MJPEG, which PrintGuard asks for first, and spread them across separate USB controllers |
| Feed plays but the risk score never moves | The monitor is in standby because its printer positively reports "not printing" | This is by design. See [failing safely](architecture.md#failing-safely) |
| Risk score keeps moving with the printer sitting idle | The service reports a state PrintGuard cannot read, so the monitor cannot be stood down | This is by design, and the monitor's panel says which state it is getting. A warning goes out once the state has been unreadable for a few seconds |
| Video is smooth for one camera and choppy for several | The host's sustainable capacity is shared across cameras | Check the **capacity** and **latency** readouts, then [Hardware](hardware.md#how-much-hardware-you-need) |
| **Capacity** fell sharply after upgrading to 2.3.7 | 2.3.7 ran inference on two workers on hosts that could sustain many more | Fixed in 2.3.8, which measures the worker count. The startup log line `inference ready:` reports what it settled on |

## Printers

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Test fails with *all connection attempts failed* | The hub is in a container, so `localhost` is the container | Use `http://host.docker.internal:5000`, and make the service listen on `0.0.0.0` on Linux hosts. [Details](printers.md#networking-caveats) |
| Test fails with *access control checks* | Local mode only, where the print service sends no CORS headers | Enable CORS in OctoPrint or add `cors_domains` to `moonraker.conf`, or use hub mode |
| Test fails with *not allowed to request resource* over HTTPS | The browser blocks an `http://` printer from an HTTPS page as mixed content | Use hub mode, where the server makes the request, or serve the printer over HTTPS |
| Bambu, Elegoo or Prusa is missing from the list | Those services need a raw socket, an access code exchange or HTTP Digest, none of which a browser can do | Use hub mode. [Supported print services](printers.md#supported-print-services) |
| Printer shows `offline` but is printing | The hub cannot reach the service | Monitoring keeps running by design. Fix reachability, then the state clears itself |
| Pause or cancel did nothing | The service rejected the action | The failure is in the alert, the dashboard error feed and the notification. Check the service's own logs |

## Detection and alerts

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Too many false alerts | Sensitivity or threshold too aggressive for your camera and lighting | Raise the threshold or lower sensitivity on that monitor, and raise the consecutive-frame count so brief blips are ridden out |
| Failures caught too late | The opposite | Lower the threshold or the frame count. Watch the risk history on the monitor's detail page to pick a value |
| No notifications arrive | The channel is off for that monitor, or the channel itself is failing | Send a test alert from **Settings**. Delivery failures raise an `error` event rather than passing silently |
| A stream of camera offline and back notifications | The feed keeps dropping out. Before 2.4.0 every reconnection announced itself, and the monitor's cooldown only covers defect alerts | Update to 2.4.0, where one unstable episode is one warning. The drop-outs themselves are worth chasing, so check the camera's own connection and, for RTSP or WHEP, that MediaMTX holds the pull |
| A wireless camera still notifies when it drops out for a few seconds | The fault grace period is shorter than the camera takes to reconnect | Raise **Fault grace period** in the Alerts tab in Settings. It goes up to fifteen minutes, and the dashboard still shows the drop-out as it happens |
| A warning that the camera dropped out for a share of the last ten minutes | It reconnects quickly enough to clear the grace period every time, so the print is only being watched part of the time | Chase the connection rather than the notification. This one fires once for the whole unstable episode |
| Pushover alerts arrive during quiet hours | Priority defaults to High, which bypasses them, and it covers every notice including warnings and recoveries | Set it to Normal in the Alerts tab in Settings. [Notifications](printers.md#notifications) |
| Telegram is not offered | Telegram's API sends no CORS headers | Hub mode only. [Notifications](printers.md#notifications) |
| Home Assistant shows nothing | The broker settings are wrong, or discovery is disabled in Home Assistant | Check the Home Assistant tab in Settings and the broker's own log |

## Plugins

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| A panel says it is waiting for permissions | The plugin was installed without granting what it asks for | Tick them under Permissions, in the Plugins tab in Settings |
| A plugin stopped on its own, with a reason | Its sandbox failed, hung or ran out of memory. PrintGuard disables a plugin rather than letting it affect anything else | The reason is on the plugin in the Plugins tab in Settings and in the log. Re-enable it once its author has fixed it |
| Installing from a repository fails | The path holds no `plugin.json`, the reference does not exist, or GitHub is rate-limiting an unauthenticated request | Check the path points at the plugin's own folder, and try again in a few minutes |
| A plugin installs as third party rather than verified | The catalogue vouches for different bytes, or does not list it at all | Expected for anything unreviewed. If it should be verified, its catalogue entry needs re-pinning |
| A plugin's requests fail | The host is not one its manifest declared, or **Reach the internet** is not granted | Both are deliberate. Only its declared hosts are reachable |
| Nothing floats when a plugin's pop-out is pressed | The feed had not started, or the browser refused it | The toast names the reason. A feed that says "starting stream" has nothing to float yet, so wait for the picture |
| Locked out of the hub by a plugin | A plugin holding **Authorise every request** is refusing them | Restart with `PRINTGUARD_PLUGINS=off` and remove it. [Deployment](deployment.md#plugins) |

## Acceleration

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| An Intel GPU is not used | The standard image leaves the Intel GPU runtime out, the render device was not passed in, or the GPU predates Tiger Lake | Use the `latest-intel` tag and pass `--device /dev/dri`. **compute** reads `intel gpu` when the GPU is in use, and the log lists what the providers offered at start. [Intel GPU](hardware.md#intel-gpu) |
| An NVIDIA GPU is not used | Missing Container Toolkit, the container started without the NVIDIA runtime, or the wrong tag | The log names the provider it could not load, then falls back to the CPU. [NVIDIA GPU](hardware.md#nvidia-gpu) |
| **compute** names a CPU on a machine with an accelerator | No provider was handed the accelerator, so the model stayed on the processor | [Execution providers by platform](hardware.md#execution-providers-by-platform) |
| Throughput differs from what you expected | Automatic mode picks whichever runtime benchmarks faster on the host | The choice is logged at start. Pin one in the Advanced tab in Settings |

## Getting logs and diagnostics

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| Container | `docker logs printguard`, or `docker compose logs -f` |
| Desktop app | A rotating log file in the app's data directory, path set by `LOG_FILE` |
| More detail | Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for command traces and exception tracebacks |
| Everything at once | The bug icon in the header, then **Download logs**, which gives you a zip of the sanitised diagnostics bundle and both log tails, with credentials stripped |

The same bug dialog sends a report straight to me, anonymously, with the same
scrubbed contents and an optional email for follow-up. Nothing leaves the machine unless you
submit it or download it yourself.

If you are stuck, open an [issue](https://github.com/oliverbravery/PrintGuard/issues) and
attach that zip.
